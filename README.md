# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
 
 This little game is based on a project idea at SoftUni. It's pretty much the same version of the game as the one described by them in the project description, but I decided to add a few while loops and make the game giong until the user decides to stop the script :).
 
 I made the input case-insensitive (if that is a word) and trimmed any stray blank spaces that might show up in user input to make it a bit more stable.
 
 It's nothing too complicated but nice to share.
